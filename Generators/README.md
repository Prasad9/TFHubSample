# Generator Module

There is no training performed in this module. Progressive GANs module has been used to generate images.

In `Main.py`, set the number of images you would like to generate in `TOTAL_IMAGES` parameter, the folder where your images should be placed in should be set in `SAVE_FOLDER` parameter. `BATCH_SIZE` parameter corresponds to how many images should be generated in one run.

To run the code, 

    python3 Main.py

This is the sample of images you are likely to get.
